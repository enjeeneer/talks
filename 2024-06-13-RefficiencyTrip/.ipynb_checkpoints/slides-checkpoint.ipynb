Then, we establish a serious of lemmas, which are published scientific truths you use as stepping stones to connect you to your axiom. Each lemma should try to get you as close as possible to maximising the axiom, or resolving the previous lemma. Eventually if you keep doing this you will run out of lemmas and you will arrive at a *problem* where there are conflicting ideas about which stepping stone comes next.

If you sit at the far end of either access you are the best in the world at that skill--so we have this guy Ed Jaynes as the GOAT bayesian statistician, and at the top of the y-axis is the GOAT gerantologist. And then we have Alice, Bob, and Carol are all some combination of the two. Alice is better at gerontology, and less good at stats, and bob is good at stats and less good at gerantology. Crucially though, they each have a unique position on the chart, and that creates areas that require the set of skills only one them has. The better you are at a combined set of skills, the more problems are accessible and solvable by you, and you alone. Another way to think about this is that you have a finite set of tokens you can spend on improving yourself (in practice this is like time). Let's say you have 100 tokens to spend on yourself, the question is what skills should you exchange your tokens for to maximally increase the number of problems that are available to you alone.
