Here, we plot demand for energy in blue and the supply of energy from the solar array in orange, for 24 hours. On a perfectly clear summers day, the energy supplied by our solar array will increase in the morning as the sun rises, peak around midday when irradiance is highest, and fall in the evening as the sun sets. In contrast, the occupant's demand for energy won't be so symmetric. They'll likely demand produce a peak in energy demand in the morning when they wake up, boil the kettle, turn the heating on and take a shower. Then, they'll head out to work and demand will fall and plateau. In the evening they'll return causing another spike in energy demand as the heating comes on, they cook dinner and turn on a range of applicances.   "

Where the storage medium in the residential example could be electrical, like a battery, it doesn't need to be, it could be thermal, like a fridge or cold storage facility. Here rather than charging a battery with excess renewable supply, we can charge the contents of the fridge with cooled air, and allow the heat to dissipate ove time in the same way we dissipate energy from the battery. As a more concrete example, if we could predict that we would have excess renewable supply throughout a morning because it was windy, and a deficit in the afternoon as the wind drops. We could use that renewable energy in the morning to overcool the space, then switch the coolers off in the afternoon, all whilst ensuring the temperature remains within a safe operating range throughout."

    "Several authors have looked at this problem in recent years with most focussing on Reinforcement Learning as a potential solution. Reinforcement Learning is a general framework for solving sequential decision making tasks with no prior knowledge of the system. We have RL agents (here illustrated by the brain) that can take actions in some environment (represented by the globe), at each timestep receiving feedback on those actions in the form of a reward, which represents how well it is doing at task it is supposed to be performing, and an updated state. The goal of the RL agent is to maximise the sum of cumulative rewards over a trajectory of actions. This is useful because in complex systems it can be hard to specify a sequence of actions we would like an agent to take. Instead it is much easier to specify a goal we are trying to achieve or how we would like the world to look upon completing the task. We can do this by specifying the reward function, which is the only bit of human intervention in this system, then we allow the agent to work out the best control policy for maximising its reward.\n",

Go is an extremely difficult game to master, historically seen as one of the hardest challenges for artificial intelligence. There are 10^170 ways to configure a Go board, meaning if you want to create a table of all the different states and search through them to find the best move you would need a computer larger than observable universe. The move highlighted in this image, move 37, became infamous in the Go world because it seemed counterintuitive to humans when played, but later turned out the be the game-winning move.

This process continues until some finite time horizon $H$ where it will receive some reward, a qunatification of how good the previous string of actions were.

    "The method for agent planning changes too, now instead of making point predictions of the outcome of action sequences, we output a distribution over all possible future rewards. In the example below, we evaluate one action sequence, passing it through three models in our ensemble, outputting state distribution predictions, sampling from that distribution and iterating until time horizon $H$. At this stage we get a distribution over rewards which we can use to get the expected value of the action sequence. Comparing this with the expected reward of many other action sequences we can find the optimal action sequence, and take the first action in that sequence in the real environment. "

    "We ran a series of experiments to test the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We test our algorithm in three varied building simulations, a mixed-use facility in Greece, an apartment block in Spain, and a seminar centre in Denmark. We compare our algorithm with an existing RBC, the state-of-the-art model-free approach and the state-of-the-art model-based approach. The agents have no prior knowledge of the system *a priori*, other than the type of actions they can take, and are each given 12 hours to explore the state-space before controlling them. The goal of each agent is to minimise emissions whilst maintaining internal temperature in the range 19-24 degrees centigrade for one year of operation."

    "1. Reducing energy use in heating and cooling systems, and better matching energy demand with carbon-free supply are important climate change mitigation tools.\n",
    "2. In theory, RL allows us to obtain emission-reducing control policies for *any* building with *no* prior knowledge.\n",
    "3. Existing RL approaches require training in hard-to-obtain simulators using millions of timesteps of data.\n",
